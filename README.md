# PhilaSpot
Finding parking in Philly shouldn’t feel like a nightmare, but anyone who’s driven here knows the struggle! Circling for 20 minutes, wasting gas, and stressing over spots. Current parking apps don’t cut it: they’re outdated, incomplete, or only show pricey garages. My solution is a smart, community-driven parking assistant built specifically for Philly. By combining real OpenDataPhilly and PPA data with live community reports and AI-powered predictions, to makes it easier to find parking before you even leave home. Unlike other tools, it brings everything together—garages, meters, permits, and even free spots—on one live map with smart search filters for price, distance, EV charging, and accessibility. With over 2,500 locations already mapped, a working reporting system, and plans to integrate real-time city data, this project is growing from a student frustration into a tool that could make Philly more livable—for drivers, businesses, and the environment.
